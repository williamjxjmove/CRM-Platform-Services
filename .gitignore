# See http://help.github.com/ignore-files/ for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global

# Ignore bundler config
/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/db/*.sqlite3

# William added on March-01,2013.
# Please note that dirs like log/,tmp/ follow project, not in the root dir, so log/*.log is more accurate than /log/*.log.

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*.log
log/*.log

/tmp/
tmp/*

# The /test is in root dir, not in project/ dir, so safe for unit-test.
/test
